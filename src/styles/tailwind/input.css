/* REUSABLE CLASSES EXTRACTIONS - only highly used classes here
Why?
You have to think up class names all the time — nothing will slow you down or drain your energy like coming up with a class name for something that doesn’t deserve to be named.
You have to jump between multiple files to make changes — which is a way bigger workflow killer than you’d think before co-locating everything together.
Changing styles is scarier — CSS is global, are you sure you can change the min-width value in that class without breaking something in another part of the site?
Your CSS bundle will be bigger — oof.
